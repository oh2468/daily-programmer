# Daily Programmer

## Description

An assortment of programming challenges found over at ```https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/```

The challenges are solved for fun, practice, learning and inspiration purposes. Meaning that the soultions aren't always elegant, readable, optimal or efficient and could be the first solution that popped in to my mind (even if a brute force one).

### Dependencies

* Python (developed with v. 3.10.5)
